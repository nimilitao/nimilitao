<h4>Hi there, I'm Nicolas and I like to build some cool stuff 👋</h4>

<p>My favorite food is Strogonoff. I love watching anything—series, movies, or anime. I also enjoy hitting the gym and drawing whenever I have the time.</p>
<p>I'm currently working at <a href="https://www.ifood.com.br" target="_blank">iFood</a>, a FoodTech that owns the leading food delivery platform in Latin America. I'm part of the Payment Engines team, which focuses on microservices architecture, primarily working with Golang on the backend. I also contribute to infrastructure-related tasks.</p>
