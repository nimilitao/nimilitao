<p> ðŸŒŠ My favorite food is Strogonoff. I love watching anything: series, movies, or anime. I also enjoy hitting the gym and drawing whenever I have the time. My biggest dream is to achieve financial freedom so I can travel wherever I want, especially to places connected to nature like beaches, mountains, and all the breathtaking landscapes this pale blue dot has to offer.  </p>
<p> ðŸ’» I' m currently working at <a href="https://www.ifood.com.br" target="_blank">iFood</a>, a FoodTech that owns the leading food delivery platform in Latin America. I'm part of the Payment Engines team, which focuses on microservices architecture, primarily working with Golang on the backend. I also contribute to infrastructure-related tasks.</p>
